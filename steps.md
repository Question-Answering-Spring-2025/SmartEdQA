core functionality in the notebook and a basic Rasa custom action working, you can integrate the notebook logic with Rasa by following these steps:

1. **Modularize the Notebook Code:**  
   - Refactor the notebook code into standalone Python functions or classes (if you havenâ€™t already).  
   - Package these functions into a separate module (e.g., `mcq_engine.py`) that can be imported by the Rasa custom actions.

2. **Integrate Into a Custom Action:**  
   - In the Rasa custom actions file (usually `actions.py`), import the new module.  
   - Create a custom action (e.g., `ActionMCQ`) that calls the functions to:  
     - Compute vector embeddings with ChromaDB for the specified book.  
     - Generate prompts and extract questions from the text using the OpenAI model logic.
   - Make sure the action processes any incoming parameters (like user input) and formats the response accordingly.

3. **Update Domain and Stories:**  
   - Add the new action (e.g., `action_mcq`) to the `domain.yml` file under the actions section.  
   - Define intents, slots, and responses related to the quiz functionality.  
   - Write stories or rules that show how and when the custom action should be triggered during the conversation.

4. **Testing and Debugging:**  
   - Run Rasa in interactive mode (`rasa interactive`) to simulate the conversation and see how the MCQ action performs.  
   - Debug any integration issues (such as data passing, API call errors, or format mismatches between the module and Rasa).

5. **Deployment Considerations:**  
   - Ensure the custom action server is correctly deployed and running alongside the Rasa server.  
   - Confirm that any dependencies required by the module (like chromadb or OpenAI libraries) are installed in the environment.
