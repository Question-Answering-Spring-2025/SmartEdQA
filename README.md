## My Project

### Installation
- upgrade your setup tools
``
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
``

then `` brew install postgresql `` 

you may opt to have this one installed too:
`` pip install absl-py==0.10.0 ``

make sure python versions are:
- python 3.7
- python 3.8
- python 3.9

others would throw a setup tool wheel error.

the next step would be `` rasa init ``. 

leave the defaults as they're so as the project directory is as.
when asked if you want to train a model say no.

do run `` rasa train `` if any changes are made to the code.

install rasa and `` rasa init `` it to have the bareback directories before you begin your project.
